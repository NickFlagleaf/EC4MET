\title{Add estimated Soil Moisture Index (SMI) to weather data}
\usage{
add.SMI(weather)
}
\arguments{
\item{weather}{A list of length 2. Weather data as outputted from the \code{\link[=get.SILO.weather]{get.SILO.weather()}}.

\code{weather$data} is a list of data matrices for each covariate with rows as environments and days of the year as columns. Weather covariate names for list items should include:
\itemize{
\item \code{daily_rain}
\item \code{max_temp}
}

\code{weather$Env.info} is a data frame of info for each environment but is not required for this function.}
}
\value{
The same \code{weather} list object as inputted with the addition of a matrix of daily SMI values in \code{...$data$smi}.
}
\description{
This function uses daily rainfall and temperature to estimate a SMI from a weather data object that has been output from
get weather functions such as \code{\link[=get.SILO.weather]{get.SILO.weather()}}.
}
\details{
A simplified SMI is calculated based on a dynamic water balance model where soil moisture is proportionally dried by daily evapotranspiration
and increased by daily precipitation. The equation for SMI for a following day(\eqn{SMI_{i+1}}) is:
\deqn{SMI_{i+1} = \min{(1,\frac{SMI_i}{\frac{PET_i}{AWC \times c_s}c_d + 1} + (P_i \times c_p))}}
where \eqn{SMI_i} is the SMI for day \eqn{i}, \eqn{PET_i} is the potential evapotranspiration using the Thornthwaite equation for day \eqn{i}, and
\eqn{P_i} is the precipitation (mm) for day \eqn{i}. The constants \eqn{c_s}, \eqn{c_d}, and \eqn{c_p} were optimised based on ground truthed data from
